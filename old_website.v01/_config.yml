  desc: 'I am a 2nd-year Ph.D. student at NUS School of Computing and am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/">Dr. Reza Shokri</a>. I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT Guwahati in May 2018. After that, I worked at Amazon India as a Software Development Engineer with Transaction Risk Management team.<br><br> During my undergrad, I developed an interest in Machine Learning algorithms and Reinforcement Learning. The unreliability and limited understanding of Deep Learning particularly interested me and consequently I tried to understand methods for analysing guarantees of RL/ML algorithms. Currently, I am working on improving the privacy guarantees of Machine Learning algorithms as well as developing attacks on ML models to extract private information.'
