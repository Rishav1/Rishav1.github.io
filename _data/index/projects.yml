- name: Dynamic Resource allocation for Fire Incidents
  i18n: dyn_res_all
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/pommerman.gif
  repo: https://gitlab.com/Rishav1/TagdaAgent/tree/simulation
  desc: As part of my AI course, we modified a Multi-agent OpenAI environment called Pommerman to simulate grid world representation of San Diego region's fire incident occurances. We trained Deep RL models to simulate efficient response/patrol paths for optimizing average response time for these incidents.

- name: Biped Robot
  i18n: bip_rob
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/biped.gif
  desc: We attempted to make a biped robot capable of dynamic walking without support. Using virtual simulations on MuJoCo, we trained a DDPG agent to make a virtual model of the biped bot walk. We attempted to transfer the learned model into the biped bot.

- name: Super Mario Bros AI
  i18n: sup_mar_ai
  gh_user: Rishav1
  repo: https://github.com/Rishav1/Super-Mario-Bros-RL-AI
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/mario.gif
  desc: Super Mario AI is an epsilon soft policy based Q-learning model that learns to plays the famous Super Nintendo Entertainment System game Super Mario Bros. I used a Lua scriptable SNES simulator to create the environment for RL models.

- name: RL Algorithm Implementations
  i18n: rl_alg_imp
  gh_user: Rishav1
  repo: https://github.com/Rishav1/baselines
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/pacman.gif
  desc: In my attempt to understand the practical difficulties of various RL algorithms, I implemented and tested a few of them like Double Q-learning Network (and it's variants like Double DQN, Recurrent DQN, Bootstrap DQN), Proximal Policy Optimization(PPO), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient(DDPG), etc. on various environments like Atari 2600, OpenAI gym, MuJoCo and Gazebo physics engine.

- name: Intranet Search Engine
  i18n: int_sea_eng
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/search_logo.gif
  desc: Worked on an intranet search engine for the institute intranet, to help securely index internal VPN.

- name: File Share Website
  i18n: int_sea_eng
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/folder.gif
  desc: Worked on a local file sharing website for the intranet to utilize high bandwidth intranet conncetion of upto 1 GB/s to locally share files.

- name: Destrangify
  i18n: destran
  gh_user: Rishav1
  repo: https://github.com/Rishav1/Destrangify
  img: /static/assets/img/landing/destrangify_logo.png
  desc: Made an augmented reality android app that allows one to lookup the shared public details of surrounding people nearby, like name and job, by pointing the smartphone camera at them. The app uses geo-based AR to locate the surrounding users in the direction of camera and applies facial recognition to distinguish them.
