    As part of my Ph.D. research work, I am interested in studying benefits of knowledge sharing among group of learners (bandits, RL agents or basic 
    function approximators) and finding ways to leverage it for speeding up learning. Non exhaustive range of topics I am interested in : <b>Social Choice Theory, Multi-agent Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Optimization algorithms</b>."
