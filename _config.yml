  desc: 'I am a 1st-year Ph.D. student at NUS School of Computing and am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~reza/">Dr. Reza Shokri</a> and <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~lowkh/research.html">Dr. Bryan Kian Hsiang Low</a>. I developed an interest in multi-agent learning during sophomore year of my undergraduate degree. Consequently, I try to understand problems and advantages of knowledge sharing among learners. In general, problems related to multi-agent learning such as divergence, adversarial attacks, exploration, etc., interest me.<br>Topics: <b>Differential Privacy, Multi-agent Learning, Reinforcement Learning</b>.'
