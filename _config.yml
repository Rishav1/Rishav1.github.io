  desc: I am currently an undergrad student, majoring in Computer Science and Technology at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati, India. My research interest lies in Artificial Intelligence in Robotics. I also am currently the club manager at Robotics Club, IITG, doing some interesting projects on AI. I like to spend my time learning about advances in reinforcement learning, and doing small projects based on RL. I care about applications of AI in simplifying day to day life.
